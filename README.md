5G Mobile Services Authorisation System Simulator - University 2ºY 2ºS

The work to be carried out in this project should simulate a real-time authorisation system where mobile users try to use several data services simultaneously. The system must receive requests to use the service and authorise them according to each customer's available ceiling. In addition to the authorisation process, aggregate utilisation statistics should also be generated, as well as alerts to users about their consumption for users.
